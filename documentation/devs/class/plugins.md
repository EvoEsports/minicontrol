# Plugin base & loader (moved)

This class-level doc has been merged into the developer-facing plugin guide:

- See [Plugins guide](../plugins.md) for the full documentation covering the base `Plugin` class, `PluginLoader` APIs, manifest schema, resolver behavior, helper methods, and examples.

If you are looking for the base class API or helpers (addListener, addCommand, addSetting, addColor, destroy, etc.), please consult the merged doc at `../plugins.md`.
